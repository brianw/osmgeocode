osmgeocode.py
=============

Very very basic geocoding for OpenStreetMap.org (OSM) data. Makes reasonable guesses at misspellings and partial names.

osm.py comes from Graphserver: http://github.com/bmander/graphserver/tree/master
and is copyright (c) 2007, Brandon Martin-Anderson under the BSD License

Spell correction logic from Peter Norvig: http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html



Usage
=====

OSM data can be a full map, a published extract map or just data exported from a tool like JOSM (http://josm.openstreetmap.de/).


>>> from osmgeocode import Geocoder
>>> from osm import OSM
>>> coder = Geocoder(OSM('sample.osm'))
>>> coder.resolve('maypark village')
('maypark village', <osm.Way instance at 0x66c1c0>)
>>> (placename, way) = coder.resolve('maypark village')
>>> way.get_projected_points()[0]
(-7.0748686999999997, 52.253002199999997)


You can also experiment from the command line:
$ ./osmgeocode.py mayprak villag
Maypark Village: (-7.0748686999999997, 52.253002199999997)

$ ./osmgeocode.py couse brid
Couse Bridge Roundabout: (-7.1151502000000004, 52.228008299999999)

$ ./osmgeocode.py tir conell ave
Tir Connell Avenue: (-7.1442591000000002, 52.250328699999997)



Bugs
====

Sometimes the combination of spelling correction and best partial match can be a little overeager.

$ ./osmgeocode.py sexy perry winkles
Six Crossroads Business Park: (-7.1448654999999999, 52.2331012)

Note: if a shop selling attractive sea food opens at the Six Crossroads Business Park, this will no longer be considered a defect.

Only way names are currently searched, point names aren't - so street names work well but a specific building (like a church) won't.
